                    <p>One of my favorite programs that i have written so far would have to be a simple Tic-Tac-Toe <br>
                    game taken a step further where there is a second additional layer. You have to win at the second <br>
                    to claim a spot on the first. It is a neat program <br>
                    <br>
                    Here is a quick snippet of the code that i wrote for it. It is written in C#.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <pre>
                        <code id="content">
                        Button b = (Button)sender; // Checks to see whose turn it is and assigns the needed sign. <br>
                        if (turn == true)
            
                            b.Text = "X";
            
                        else 
            
                            b.Text = "O";
                        turn = !turn;
                        b.Enabled = false; //Disables the button
                        turnCounter++; // Counts to see how many turns there have been in case of a draw
                        CheckWinner(); // Method being called to check the winner
                        </code>
                    </pre>
